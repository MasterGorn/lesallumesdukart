                    <p>This secret shortcut on <strong>Koopa Beach</strong> trades items for speed. 🌊🐢</p>
                    <p>Indeed, taking the left path is a shortcut, but the item boxes are located in the right branch. 🎁➡️</p>
                    <ol>

                        <li><strong>🛠️ Technique</strong>: To make the most of it, perform a drift by turning left, then another by turning right and finally a third by turning left. 🚗💨</li>
                        <li><strong>💡 Tip</strong>: Think carefully about your strategy: do you prefer immediate time savings or items for the long run? 🤔</li>

                        <li><strong>🏎️ No-item technique</strong>: This shortcut can be taken without any items by jumping at the very last moment using <strong>R</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>🍄 Easier with a boost</strong>: It’s much easier to pull off with a 🍄 or a 🌟.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>🚀 Boost at the start</strong>: Perform a turbo boost right from the start.</li>

                        <li><strong>🚉 Checkpoint</strong>: You’ll crash into the barrier, and Lakitu will reposition you on the road.</li>
                        <li><strong>🔁 Second step</strong>: Turn right and crash into the next barrier. This time, Lakitu will place you on the lower level of the track, saving you half a lap! 🎉</li>

                    <p>It’s a two-step shortcut that can make all the difference in the race! 🏎️💨</p>

                    <p>2 secret shortcuts in this video! 🕵️‍♂️</p>
                    <p><strong>Wario Stadium</strong> is the perfect place to cheat, packed with secret shortcuts! Here’s the first one:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>📍 Right from the start</strong>: Jump at the first bump to hit the wall and cross to the other side.</li>
                        <li><strong>💡 Tip</strong>: The top of the bump lowers the wall’s height, making this shortcut easier to take.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ Warning</strong>: Avoid doing a boost start! While it’s possible, it’s much harder. Jumping off the first bump is easier, though it’s also doable with the others.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Soon, you won’t even remember the start of the track! 🏎️ And even if you struggle with the later shortcuts, you can always finish the race semi-legitimately. 🎮</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Make sure you have enough speed</strong>: Either chain it directly after the first shortcut or take some distance to build momentum.</li>
                        <li><strong>💥 Hit the wall</strong>: Aim for the wall, press <strong>R</strong> to jump over it, and land on the other side.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ Watch your angle</strong>: Jumping at the wrong angle might place you on the wrong side of the finish line, negating the benefits of the first shortcut.</li>

                    <p>On Royal Raceway, the race is no longer traditional, and luck plays a big role! 🎲</p>
                    <p>Here’s how to take advantage of this glitch:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>📍 Spot the one-third mark of the track</strong>: At this point, a good jump to the other bank can trick the game into thinking you fell from the top of the bridge.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Gain half a lap</strong>: If it works, the game will place you back near the ramp, saving you half a lap.</li>
                        <li><strong>🍄 Use a boost</strong>: You’ll need one of the following: a 🍄, triple 🍄, or a golden 🍄.</li>
                        <li><strong>🎯 Be precise</strong>: Compared to the dividing line between the left and right dirt sections, aim to the right to trick the game.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚔️ Counterplay for opponents</strong>: Opponents can only use 👻 or ⚡ items to counter this lucky strategy.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>With a bit of practice and luck, this glitch can make all the difference in the race! 🏎️✨</p>

                        <li>🍄 <b>Efficiency</b>: You save a mushroom since the necessary acceleration was provided by the perfect boost.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>🏁 Even harder than taking the time to position yourself and using a mushroom, but it makes a difference if your friends use the easier method.</p>

                    <ol>

                        <li><strong>🍄 Recommended boost</strong>: Use a mushroom to make the trick easier.</li>
                        <li><strong>🔄 Direction change</strong>: You’ll be placed further down the track, but facing the wrong way.</li>

                    <ol>

                        <li><strong>💥 Take the shell head-on</strong>: Position yourself so that the shell hits you and launches you over the barrier. 🛑</li>
                        <li><strong>✨ Magic effect</strong>: You’ll cross the finish line 🏁 to complete your lap and be placed back by Lakitu 🪂 in front of the line, gaining a full lap! 🎉</li>
                        <li><strong>🛠️ Practical tips</strong>: It’s easier to execute this trick with 3 green shells 🐢 by shooting them at the barrier and letting one hit you on the rebound. 🔄</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>🎲 <strong>It’s a tricky but rewarding strategy</strong>, perfect for desperate situations. Good luck, champ! 🏆✨</p>
