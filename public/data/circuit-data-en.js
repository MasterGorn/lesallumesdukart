                    <p>You’ll see that <b>red shells</b> truly change the game’s meta! They allow you to gain an extra lap on multiple tracks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>🔴 <b>Get a red shell</b>: Make sure you have <b>one or three red shells</b> as your first item! Drive slowly at the start to avoid being <b>first or last</b>.</li>
                        <li>🎲 <b>Luck and decision</b>: If you haven’t gotten a red shell, decide whether to try again with new items. 
                            - <b>1 in 20 chance</b> when <b>1st</b> 
                            - <b>1 in 3</b> when <b>2nd</b>

                            It may be worth insisting.</li>
                        <li>🎯 <b>Technique</b>: Drive <b>backwards</b> towards the <b>finish line</b> and fire your <b>red shell</b>. It will come back to you, and you need to collide with it at the right moment to get launched into the scenery.</li>
                        <li>🏁 <b>Outcome</b>: You’ll be repositioned just before the finish line, so simply cross it to gain an extra lap! If you got <b>three red shells</b>, you can repeat the trick.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>🏁 Immediate dive</strong>: When taking the final ramp option, you must immediately go into the water.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ Do not press Z</strong>: Avoid pressing Z to get the item quickly. The item wheel must spin until you are far enough into the water.</li>
                        <li><strong>🎭 Trick the game</strong>: In the water, if you are far enough, the console assumes you are in last place, causing a rapid position change (even though you’re still leading).</li>
                        <li><strong>💫 Powerful items</strong>: The game will give you an item meant for the last-place player, often a ⭐️ or a ⚡.</li>

                    <p>❄️ Glagla Pass is known for its iconic shortcut at the bridge, but for those who race normally, it hides a few small shortcuts, including this one:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>🏎️ Cut through the snow</strong>: In the turns before the bumps, simply drive through the snow to save time.</li>
                        <li><strong>🍄 Use a speed boost</strong>: A mushroom or a star is necessary to avoid slowing down too much.</li>
                        <li><strong>⛄ Watch out for obstacles</strong>: Be careful of the snowmen that can slow you down!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>⏳ This shortcut won't save you a huge amount of time, but it's always good to know!</p>

                    <p>2 secret shortcuts in this video! 🕵️‍♂️</p>
                    <p><strong>Wario Stadium</strong> is the perfect place to cheat, packed with secret shortcuts! Here’s the first one:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>📍 Right from the start</strong>: Jump at the first bump to hit the wall and cross to the other side.</li>
                        <li><strong>💡 Tip</strong>: The top of the bump lowers the wall’s height, making this shortcut easier to take.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ Warning</strong>: Avoid doing a boost start! While it’s possible, it’s much harder. Jumping off the first bump is easier, though it’s also doable with the others.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Soon, you won’t even remember the start of the track! 🏎️ And even if you struggle with the later shortcuts, you can always finish the race semi-legitimately. 🎮</p>

                    <p>If you’ve already taken the first shortcut on this track, why stop there? 🚀</p>
                    <p>For this second shortcut:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Make sure you have enough speed</strong>: Either chain it directly after the first shortcut or take some distance to build momentum.</li>

                        <li><strong>⚠️ Watch your angle</strong>: Jumping at the wrong angle might place you on the wrong side of the finish line, negating the benefits of the first shortcut.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Make sure you have enough speed</strong>: Drive straight after the bumps, the wall is at the end.</li>

                        <li><strong>🎯 Be precise</strong>: Compared to the dividing line between the left and right dirt sections, aim to the right to trick the game.</li>

                    <p>🏎️ Royal Raceway has a shortcut that is as useless as it is difficult.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>🎯 Precise execution</strong>: To succeed, you must take the ramp properly by power sliding.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ A tricky angle</strong>: The angle is very precise. If you touch the left edge of the ramp, you will fall. If you don’t turn enough, you’ll hit the mountain.</li>
                        <li><strong>📍 Impact point</strong>: The key is to hit the edge at the brown-green marking as far as possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>⏳ No real time gain</strong>: By looking at the opponent’s icon, you’ll notice the gap remains the same. This shortcut doesn’t actually save time.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>🏁 A secret shortcut worth knowing for the glory, but not really useful!</p>

                    <p>Why race through Yoshi Valley when you can skip it entirely!</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>📍 <b>Positioning</b>: Place yourself a little past the starting line. Turn left and go behind the tree. Stay to the right of the tree.</li>
                        <li>🎯 <b>Precision</b>: Aim to hit the cliff at the right spot and, most importantly, jump before the descent near the grass to clear the railing.</li>
                        <li>🏆 <b>Advantage</b>: You fall to the back of the track, and the game will think you were near the finish line. It will place you behind the line, but with a lap counted!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>🏁 Easier than at the start, but it still requires the mandatory use of a mushroom.</p>
