                    <p>Indeed, taking the left path is a shortcut, but the item boxes are located in the right branch. 🎁➡️</p>

                        <li><strong>🛠️ Technique</strong>: To make the most of it, perform a drift by turning left, then another by turning right and finally a third by turning left. 🚗💨</li>
                        <li><strong>💡 Tip</strong>: Think carefully about your strategy: do you prefer immediate time savings or items for the long run? 🤔</li>

                        <li><strong>🏎️ No-item technique</strong>: This shortcut can be taken without any items by jumping at the very last moment using <strong>R</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>🍄 Easier with a boost</strong>: It’s much easier to pull off with a 🍄 or a 🌟.</li>

                        <li><strong>🏎️ Momentum</strong>: Get a bit of momentum, but not too much, or your kart will jump higher than the cave entrance. 🎯</li>

                        <li><strong>🚉 Checkpoint</strong>: You’ll crash into the barrier, and Lakitu will reposition you on the road.</li>

                    <p>2 secret shortcuts in this video! 🕵️‍♂️</p>
                    <p><strong>Wario Stadium</strong> is the perfect place to cheat, packed with secret shortcuts! Here’s the first one:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>📍 Right from the start</strong>: Jump at the first bump to hit the wall and cross to the other side.</li>
                        <li><strong>💡 Tip</strong>: The top of the bump lowers the wall’s height, making this shortcut easier to take.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ Warning</strong>: Avoid doing a boost start! While it’s possible, it’s much harder. Jumping off the first bump is easier, though it’s also doable with the others.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Soon, you won’t even remember the start of the track! 🏎️ And even if you struggle with the later shortcuts, you can always finish the race semi-legitimately. 🎮</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>⚡ Make sure you have enough speed</strong>: Either chain it directly after the first shortcut or take some distance to build momentum.</li>
                        <li><strong>💥 Hit the wall</strong>: Aim for the wall, press <strong>R</strong> to jump over it, and land on the other side.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚠️ Watch your angle</strong>: Jumping at the wrong angle might place you on the wrong side of the finish line, negating the benefits of the first shortcut.</li>

                        <li><strong>⚡ Gain half a lap</strong>: If it works, the game will place you back near the ramp, saving you half a lap.</li>
                        <li><strong>🍄 Use a boost</strong>: You’ll need one of the following: a 🍄, triple 🍄, or a golden 🍄.</li>
                        <li><strong>🎯 Be precise</strong>: Compared to the dividing line between the left and right dirt sections, aim to the right to trick the game.</li>
                        <li><strong>⚔️ Counterplay for opponents</strong>: Opponents can only use 👻 or ⚡ items to counter this lucky strategy.</li>
